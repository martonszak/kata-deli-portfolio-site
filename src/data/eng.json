    "introduction": "I'm Kata Deli, a graphic designer. I completed my studies at VISART College, majoring in Visual Communication - Graphic and Digital Design. \n I have been working as a graphic designer for more than 10 years, in various fields. I love my work and through it, I get to know different people, professional areas, and needs, and by assessing and getting to know them, I can create the most suitable visual solution for them. I consider it essential to be up to date with new trends and to keep up with the developing technical world, so I am constantly training myself in various courses (web design, UI design, animation, and kinetic typography). I adapt the graphic material to the customer's needs.",
